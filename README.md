# nano-assignment
In this assignment you will create a cheat sheet for using the Linux text editor nano. You will be using nano extensivelly in this class and knowing the main key-bindings will make your use of nano more efficient and faster.

After accepting ther nano-assignment` complete the following steps:

1. Create a directory called `repos` in your home directory on your Raspberry Pi. Set the new directory as your current working directory.

2. Clone the nano-assignment from the remote repository on gitHub to a local repository on your Raspberry Pi. Once you cloed the repos you will have a new directory in your repos directory with the name of the assignment. Set the assignment directory as your working directory.

3. Using nano or touch, create a new text file called `nano-cheat-sheet.txt`1. In the next steps you will be adding information to your `nano-cheat-sheet.txt` file using nano. In the `nano-cheat-sheet.txt` file you will defining a number of nano key-bindings (keys you press) and what they do. for example the first line will look like this:

```
Ctrl+X : exit nano. 
```

4. Go ahead and add the first line, save (Ctrl+O) and commit the `nano-cheat-sheet.txt` file.

5. Add the definitions of the following key bindings: Ctrl+W, Ctrl+K, 
Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Esc g, Esc $, Esc L (pay particular attention 
to what the difference is between Esc $ and Esc L)

Note: Ctrl+A = press the control key and the letter A 
 *simultaneously* while Esc g = press the escape key first followed by 
the letter g (not simulataneously). Make sure you commit regularly (often and small - commit after adding each definition).
   
6. Now you will define the following useful options that you can use when starting nano: -$, -i, -W, -S 

7. Make a final commit of your cheat sheet and push your local repos to GitHub.
